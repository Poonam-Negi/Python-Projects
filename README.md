# Python-Projects
This repository showcases a set of Python projects I developed as part of my learning journey.Each project reflects my hands-on practice with fundamental programming concepts, GUI development, and problem-solving. By building these projects, I gained insights into Python's versatility and its application in real-world scenarios.

ðŸ“š Projects Overview

1. Simple Banking System

This is a command-line interface (CLI) application that simulates a basic banking system. It allows users to deposit money, view their balance, withdraw funds, and exit the system. The project is designed as a practical exercise to understand core Python programming concepts such as functions, conditional statements, and loops.

### Features
- Deposit Money: Users can deposit an amount, which gets added to their current balance.
- Show Balance: Displays the user's current balance in a user-friendly format.
- Withdraw Money: Allows users to withdraw an amount, ensuring sufficient funds are available.
- Exit: Provides the option to exit the application.

### Purpose
- To learn and implement Python's core programming constructs:
  - Functions
  - Input handling
  - Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
  - Loops (`while`)
- To practice structuring and managing a simple application.

### How It Works
1. The application starts with an initial balance of `0`.
2. Users are presented with a menu to choose one of the available options:
   - View balance
   - Deposit money
   - Withdraw money
   - Exit the program
3. Based on user input, the application performs the desired operation.
4. Input validation ensures invalid or negative amounts are not accepted.

### Sample Flow

3. GUI Unit Converter

A user-friendly GUI application for converting units like meters, kilometers, centimeters, and millimeters. Built with `Tkinter`, this tool allows for seamless unit conversions through an intuitive interface.

### Features
- Unit Conversion: Convert between meters, kilometers, centimeters, and millimeters.  
- Responsive Design: Modern and clean GUI with dropdowns for unit selection.  
- Error Handling: Provides feedback for invalid inputs.

### How to Run
